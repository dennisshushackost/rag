    "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) has to goal to take information and pass it to a Large Language Model (LLM) so it can generate outputs based on that information. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieval**: Find relevant information given a user query. I.e. What are the macronutrients and what do they do -> Retrives any passages of text related to the macronutrients from a nutritien textbook. \n",
    "* **Augmented**: We want to take the relevant information from our data and then augment our imput (prompt) to an LLM with that relevant information. \n",
    "* **Generation**: Take the first two stepes and pass them to an LLM for a good output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why RAG? \n",
    "The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation output of LLMs.\n",
    "1. Prevent Hallucinations - LLMs are good at generating good looking text, however it may not be factual.\n",
    "RAG can help LLMs create text based on text that is factual. \n",
    "2. Many LLMs are trained on internet data, as such they have a good understanding of language. RAG allows us to use custom data. We can use customer support Q&A for chatting. We can retrieve relevant snippets of text for example. We can retrieve the snippets and then use an LLM to craft an answer from these snippets. \n",
    "3. Why run it locally. We do not have to wait for any transfers. Cost is another big factor. If we own our own hardware, we can save on large amounts of costs. Furthermore, there is no vendor locking, when we run our own software, hardware. If OpenAI or another large internet company shuts down, we can still run the buisness. Privacy - Id you have documentation, maybe you do not want to send it to an API. You want to setup an LLM and run it on your own hardware."

Some studies do provide evidence that in comparison to other diets, low-carbohydrate diets improve insulin levels and other risk factors for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The overall scientific consensus is that consuming fewer calories in a balanced diet will promote health and stimulate weight loss, with significantly better results achieved when combined with regular exercise. Health Benefits of Whole Grains in the Diet While excessive consumption of simple carbohydrates is potentially bad for your health, consuming more complex carbohydrates is extremely beneficial to health. There is a wealth of scientific evidence supporting that replacing refined grains with whole grains decreases the risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Whole grains are great dietary sources of fiber, vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and a vast amount of beneficial plant chemicals, all of which contribute to the effects of whole grains on health.

A human body is made up of mostly water. An adult consists of about 37 to 42 liters of water, or about eighty pounds. Fortunately, humans have compartmentalized tissues; otherwise we might just look like a water balloon! Newborns are approximately 70 percent water. Adult males typically are composed of about 60 percent water and females are about 55 percent water. (This gender difference reflects the differences in body-fat content, since body fat is practically water-free. This also means that if a person gains weight in the form of fat the percentage of total body water content declines.) As we age, total body water content also diminishes so that by the time we are in our eighties the percent of water in our bodies has decreased to around 45 percent. Does the loss in body water play a role in the aging process? Alas, no one knows. But, we do know that dehydration accelerates the aging process whereas keeping hydrated decreases headaches, muscle aches, and kidney stones. Additionally a study conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle found that women who drank more than five glasses of water each day had a 1 significantly decreased risk for developing colon cancer. 1.

Since foods of the Pacific cross over multiple categories of both the MyPlate and SPC Dietary Guidelines foods are organized into 3 neutral categories: • Walks along the Ground (animals) • Chosen from the Sea (seafood) • Grown from the Ground (plants) The Pacific Food Guide allows users to identify with the origin of specific Pacific foods and see how these foods fit into both dietary guidelines using a unique set of pins (see image below).
